You think I'm uneducated and wild,
Try to put yourself in my shoes
I thought you'd be wiser
Why talk like that?
Didn't you come as a friend?
And what do you have more to know about it than I do?
Everything...
Do you think you'll become the master of the whole Universe...
By simply putting one foot down?
Me, I know by heart all Creation
By his soul, by his colour, by his name...
Do you think you can impose your laws everywhere
Do you really think you're right about everything?
How about you follow these mysterious steps
You'd discover a wonderful world!
Did you hear the wolf howling in love?
Do you see all the splendours in the firmament?
And do you know the whippoorwill when it flies?
Can you admire all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?
Discover the paths embalming the pine tree
Taste the sun-drenched fruit
And wrap yourself up in this coat of wonder...
Life is the most precious of our possessions!
The storm and the river are also my brothers...
The heron and the otter are my friends...
We're all part of that Ferris wheel.
We all belong to this great whole!
And where will the eagles make their nest?
If you cut down their tree, you'll ruin their lives!
If you don't want to hear the wolf howling for love...
If you refuse to see that we're alike.
And that we will soon have to learn to live together
You'll never see the colours of the wind...
Even if you want all the land,
you'll have nothing but his dust
If you don't want to capture all the colors of the wind!
