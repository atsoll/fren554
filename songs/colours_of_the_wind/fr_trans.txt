For you, I am the ignorant savage
You tell me about my difference
I believe without malice
But if in your language
You use the word wild
It's because your eyes are filled with clouds
Of clouds....
You believe that the land belongs to you entirely
For you, it's just a dust mat.
I know that the stone, the bird and the flowers
Have a life, have a mind and a heart
For you, the stranger is only called a man
That if he looks like you and thinks your way
But as you follow in his footsteps, you wonder
Are you sure, deep down, that you're right?
Do you understand the song of hope of the wolf dying of love
The crying of the wild cat in the early morning?
Do you hear the spirits of the mountain singing?
Can you paint the air of the wind in a thousand colours?
Can you paint the air of the wind in a thousand colours?
Let's run through the forests of gold and light
Do we share the ripe fruits of life
The earth offers us its treasures, its mysteries
Happiness here on earth is priceless
I am the daughter of the torrents, the sister of the rivers
The otter and the heron are my friends
And we turn, all together, as the days go by
In a circle, an infinite round
Up there, the sycamore tree is asleep
Like the golden eagle, he holds the imperial throne
Nature's creatures need clean air
And no matter what color their skin is
We all sing the songs of the mountain together
Dreaming of being able to paint the air of the wind
But the earth is just dust
As long as man doesn't know how
He can paint in a thousand colors the air of the wind
