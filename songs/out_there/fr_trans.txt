Protected from windows and stone parapets
I watch people live from below
Every day I envy their lives, me who lives alone
But I don't know their story.
I learn their songs, their laughter, their faces
I see them but they don't see me
I would like to meet these characters in turn
Just one day
At the foot of the towers
All the way down
Living in the bright sunshine
Without looking at the sky
Only once
Share their joys
I think so.
Let them not hear the voice
From my heart
Who's dying
When I see the people from below
Downstairs, I hear weavers, millers and their wives
Their carefree happiness burns me and inflames me
Their cries that resonate up to the Notre-Dame choir
Make tears bleed in the heart of my soul
If I had this life
I would live in madness
Downstairs
On the banks of the Seine
I would taste the joy
People walking around
If for one day
One day only
I was leaving my tower
That would be wonderful.
To be happy
In my turn
Take a walk
Surrounding area
From my tower
Just one day
One day
Downstairs
