Sheltered behind these stones, huddled under these ramparts...
I'm hiding from all these people down here
My whole life unfolds above their gaze
Why do they have to ignore everything about me?
All my life I'll hide my face from them
They won't know my name or my age!
All my life I've wanted to live one day among them...
Yes among them,
I only have one wish!
To live downstairs
among all these people
Only one day down there
I only ask for one.
I want to, you know I do!
Downstairs,
where happy people live
It will be,
wonderful
Yes, only one day among them
Down below are the artisans, their wives and children...
I know all these people, all these merchants...
They don't know how lucky they are to live like this...
Nothing says if only they like it!
If only once
I could taste it, just for a moment!
Downstairs,
wandering around
Just once
Like one of those passers-by,
prosperous
down there!
Yes only once
I would be so happy
Only once
Will do,
I promise,
for life!
If once,
I'm having a
day
down there!
