Beata Maria
You know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud
Beata Maria
You know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
Then tell me, Maria
Why I see her dancing there
Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul
I feel her, I see her
The sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Like fire
Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning
Desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault
I'm not to blame
It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
It's not my fault
If in God's plan
He made the devil so much stronger than a man
Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone
Hellfire
Dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or
Your pyre
Be mine or you will burn
God have mercy on her
God have mercy on me
But she will be mine
Or she will burn!
