Beata Maria
I am a firm and upright man
Of my virtues I've done right by the job.
Beata Maria
The Law, just as my Faith excludes me
From this vulgar, vile and corrupt world
Then tell me why,
when I watch her dance
Does his gaze inflame my heart?
Hell is in his eyes
The black reflections of her hair
Will always dazzle me with their splendour!
Hell is
raging
It rages in my heart
Sin
defeated
I confess my mistake
It's not my fault
I'm not wrong!
It's that Gypsy witch
Who put a spell on me
It's not my fault
If You my God
You've made the Demon the stronger of the two!
Protect me, Maria
Spells from that mermaid
Deliver venom into my veins
Kill Esmerelda
Let it sink into the flames of Gehenna!
Or let her become mine!
By Hell,
I curse you,
you don't have much choice
Is it me, or
you perish,
take me or you'll burn
God have mercy on her
God have mercy on me
She'll be mine.
Or she'll burn!
