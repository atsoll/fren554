Beata Maria
I claim that my soul is pure
Of my virtue, I have a right to be proud
Beata Maria
My heart has much more righteousness
That a common vulgar crowd of drag queens
But why, Maria.
When she dances, the insolent one
Her fiery eyes kiss and haunt me?
What burn, what torture
The flames in his hair
Devour my body of obscene wilt
Infernal
Bacchanal
Hell is darkening my flesh
Of sin
eager
Heaven must punish me
Is it my fault?
Why the blame?
It's that gypsy witch
By whom my heart is inflamed
Is it my fault?
If our Father
Has made Men less powerful than Lucifer?
For pity's sake, Maria.
Protect me from bad luck
Of this flower of evil and its body
Destroy Esmerelda
Let a curtain of fire be its shroud
Or make her mine and mine alone
Infernal
bacchanal
Evil witch
Be mine or
my passion
Will lead you to Hell
Lord have mercy on her
Lord have mercy on me
Make her offer herself to me
Or she'll burn.
