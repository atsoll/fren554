I don't know, Lord, if these words
Will ascend to Heaven
If you can hear everything upstairs
This very humble appeal
I, the outcast, the impure, the Gypsy...
In You, I always hope
For in the heart of Our Lady
The outcasts have the right to love
Protect, my God,
the unfortunate
Enlightens the misery of lonely hearts
No soul but me will hear them...
If you're deaf to the love beggars
I want gold,
I want the glory
I want my memory to be honoured one day...
Make people love me,
Immortal God
We beseech Your Grace, O Eternal King...
I desire nothing,
neither fame nor property
But the hungry beggar has to beg for his bread.
Hear for my brothers
this humble prayer
For the wretched
are children of God
All the wretched
are children of God
