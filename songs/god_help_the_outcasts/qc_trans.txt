The Lord is listening to me
There's a long way from Heaven to Earth
Will you ever hear
all those prayers?
I know I'm just an outcast.
Unworthy of anything
But would you have been with us
when on Earth did you come?
God helps the outcasts.
See their misery
May your mercy reach us on this earth...
Hear your grace your people in prayer
God help the Excluded or we are lost...
Money, Lord
Glory, Lord
Lord, we beseech thee for all thy favors...
All your favors
You Almighty
Grant us power, wealth and happiness!
Help, O Lord!
Help my people
I beg your mercy for those who have nothing...
I pray for my people
The poor and the beggars
Since we are all
of the Children of God
God helps the Excluded
Children of God
