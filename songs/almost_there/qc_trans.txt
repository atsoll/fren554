You're gonna have to wait a little bit
I don't have time to think about that.
And that's not like me.
Everything in this town is too slow
People are never angry
But I know very well what's ahead of me.
And I swear to you, it's just a matter of will...
I've decided
Yes, decided
People say it's crazy.
But I'm laughing about it
Living with worries is over.
No, nothing can stop me now
Because I've decided
Tales of fees come true
Even our wildest dreams
But we must not let go
Because everything depends on us
I've worked hard every day of the year...
I want to make sure I get there.
Anyway, I believe in it...
The hedge of honor will be for me
Yes, I've decided
Yes, decided
People will come from all over the world to eat
Because I've decided
Yes, decided
The hardships I've been through
Have often made me cry
But I'll knock down walls
Mountain climbing
I've decided
I've decided
Yes, decided
