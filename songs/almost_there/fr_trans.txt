I still have a long way to go.
I don't have time to waste my time
There is a more urgent need on earth
This town is too quiet.
Life flows slowly
I know where I've been going for so long.
And I will always, always move forward
I'll go to the end of the dream
At the end of the dream
If I meet mountains
I lift them up
If I fall, it's enough for me to get up again
Then nothing can stop me.
I'll go to the end of the dream
And as my father used to say
"You will one day succeed
Don't spare your efforts
Do it with love"
So every morning I get to work
And I'm going to win this battle
It's almost the big day
It's my turn, yes, it's my turn
I'll go to the end of the dream
At the end of the dream
And for that I will work without a break
I'll go to the end of the dream
At the end of the dream
Like everyone else, I made mistakes.
I'm not perfect.
But I'm reaching the top
I know that one day
I'll go to the end of the dream
At the end of the dream
At the end of my dream.
