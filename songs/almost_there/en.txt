That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style
This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
Getting closer and closer every day
And I'm almost there,
I'm almost there
People down here think I'm crazy,
But I don't care
Trials and tribulations, I’ve had my share
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now
‘cause I'm almost there
I remember Daddy told me:
“Fairytales can come true
You gotta make them happen,
It all depends on you"
So I work real hard each and every day
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys, I'm coming through
And I'm almost there,
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed the mountain,
I've crossed the river
And I'm almost there,
I'm almost there
I'm almost there!
