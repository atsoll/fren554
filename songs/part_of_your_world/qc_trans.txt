Look at that,
it's really nice,
I'm told my collection is complete.
Do you think I'm the girl, the girl who's really everything.
And what a booty,
here engulfed,
how many wonders does my cave hold in store?
You could say of this girl:
Yes - that she really has it all.
I've got gizmos and lots of junk,
I get stuff and blurts like this.
We're looking for sludge? There's 20 of them!
But I don't care, what's the point? I want more.
I want to be up there with everybody.
I want to see them, I want to see them dance.
I want to see them waltz around on their -
them, how do you say? Oh! Feet!
With fins, we're not going anywhere.
Legs would be needed for jumping and dancing.
And walk along the -
some, how do you say? Streets!
A trot here and a trot there,
a race this way.
And under the sun, we'll meet again.
Free as air,
there on that land,
among these people.
What would I give to be free of this life in the water?
What would I give for a day on the warm sand?
Up there on Earth,
fathers include
not to scold their grieving daughters.
All those young women, happy and proud,
feet on the ground.
I want to know everything, understand and know.
Ask my questions, learn my lessons.
What about fire and why it - tell me the word. Burns?
When is the day I can discover these enchanted shores?
Free as air,
there, on that land,
among these people.
