Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I got twenty
But who cares? No big deal. I want more
I want to be where the people are
I want to see, want to see them dancing
Walking around on those
(What do you call them?) oh - feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again? street
Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world
What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet you on land
They understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women. Sick of swimming.
Ready to stand
And ready to know what the people know
Ask them my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it ... what's the word? burn?
When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
