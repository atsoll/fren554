All these secrets,
that I kept,
Don't you think the fairies have made me happy,
Don't you think I'm far too spoiled by life,
Look at these treasures
and these wonders,
All this wealth shining like suns,
When you see that, you think,
"Yes, it's a paradise"
I have gadgets, shock stuff, cool stuff,
I have couics and couacs all over the place.
Do you want a drag gun? I have a lot of them!
But I don't care about any of this... And bores me....
I would like to travel the world,
I would like to see the world dance,
Seeing him walk on his....
what's it called? Ah! Feet
We're not going anywhere by beating fins
You need legs to jump and dance
Stroll along these...
what's it called? Streets...
If the man walks,
if the man runs,
If he can on earth dream in the open
As I would like to,
if I could,
To go there,
I'll give, all I have, to get out of here
To caress, the golden grains, hot sand...
Men understand,
I'm sure you will.
And their daughters can dream without fear
Mermaid women, human women
I have made my choice...
I want to know, I want to be able to,
Ask questions and get answers,
What is fire, why is it what it is again? Burn it! Burn it!
Someday I'll leave, I'll leave without any regrets
Living on earth,
far from the sea,
Going there......
