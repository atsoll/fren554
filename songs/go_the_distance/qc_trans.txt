I dreamed of a world
Wonderful, far away
I feel in my soul
This need to be loved
Then to be surrounded
From a crowd cheering for me...
And I hear a voice
Who shows me where my path is
And I'll make my way
I believe in my destiny!
I point to the top
I no longer fear anything
And you never know
I could prove
That I know where I come from
Finally, where I belong!
Yes, I'm going my own way
I believe in my destiny!
In me I have faith
I don't fear anything anymore!
And you never know
I could prove
That I know where I come from
Finally, where I belong!
