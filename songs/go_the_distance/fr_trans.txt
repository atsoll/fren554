I have often dreamed of
From a distant country
Where everyone would love me as
The most precious friend
A thousand echoes of their joy
Infinite amount
And their voices sing within me
You were born for this life
I'm going to take the path
From my childhood dream
Towards a future
To the glorious destiny
Among the stars
I am looking for, ideal
This world to which I belong
Which is still a long way off
It's a beautiful morning
To seize this opportunity
That takes me away
To other destinies
So that on the way
I finally discover that
What my heart seeks in vain
The world that is mine
