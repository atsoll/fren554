I confess that in the past I have been naughty
Of magic, of witchcraft, I was the queen.
But you'll see that today
I've changed my ways
Repented, I converted
That's right!
And I've kept a few little tricks in my bag
It's one of the talents I've always had
And lately, please
I had to use it
To save all these beggars, these pitiful people
What misery!
Poor little souls in pain
Suffering, heartbreaking
One dream of a slim waist
The other one wants to charm the girl
Who's going to help them?
Me, of course!
My poor little souls in pain
It's sad, it's true!
They all come begging me
"Cast a spell, Ursula!"
I do.
Not to mention
Sometimes one or two clients
Didn't pay me cash
And I had to give them a little hearing.
Yes, of course, there were complaints
But deep down I'm a Saint
For those poor little souls in pain!
Up there men don't like too much verbiage
They call magpies the ones who make small talk
Yes on Earth, it's obvious
Women keep their mouths shut, it's a good idea
And after all, my dear, why do we have to gossip?
As if all are yielded by conversation
A gentleman neither pays attention
He will strive to please
to the lady who knows how to keep her mouth shut
It's gonna be true love all your life!
Come on, my poor, sorrowful little soul!
Take it on you!
Make your choice!
I'm a busy woman and I don't have all day
It's not that expensive!
Just your voice!
My poor little soul in pain!
It's sad, but true!
You want to tempt your destiny
Little girl, you have to pay your dues
Take your courage in both hands
Sign at the bottom of the scroll!
My loves, she's mine now!
I'll scream for joy!
This poor little soul in pain!
