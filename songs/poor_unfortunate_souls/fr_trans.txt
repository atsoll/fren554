I wasn't always nice and sincere,
I've really earned the witch's name.
But you'll see that today,
I'm good with people,
Repented, I wanted to turn back.
Yes? Yes!
It's true I do know a little magic,
It's a talent I've always possessed.
That today, out of the goodness of my heart
I put, I proclaim it,
At the service of all hopeless cases.
Pathetic!
Poor souls in distress,
In pain of everything.
This soul dreams of being a skeleton,
The other one's looking for a crush,
What am I saying?
I say yes!
All those souls in perdition,
In pain of everything.
They come in my cauldrons,
Shouting, "Ursula save us."
And I accept,
what a question!
He came in anyway,
That one can't pay,
And that I confess to frying him, without compassion.
It's true I've had complaints,
But all things considered, I'm a Saint!
For all souls in perdition!
Ah, I can tell the Humans don't like blabbermouths,
Let them think that chatterboxes are boring!
That when a woman knows how to hold her tongue..,
She's always so much more charming,
After all, what's the point of being a scientist?
Besides, they have a holy horror of conversation,
A gentleman will do anything to avoid it.
But they roll over and crawl to their feet
of the reserved woman,
It's the Queen of Silence who gets loved!
Don't be afraid, poor souls in perdition,
Make up your mind,
take your pick!
I'm a very busy woman, and I won't be here all day.
It won't cost you
than your voice!
My poor soul in perdition,
Love-sick.
If you really want to cross the bridge,
You have to pay the bill.
Swallow well, take a deep breath,
Sign the contract and put your name on it.
Flotsam, Jetsam, I've got her, kids,
I'm completing my collection,
Of a poor soul in perdition!
