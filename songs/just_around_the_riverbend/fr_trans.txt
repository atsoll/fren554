My favorite thing about rivers,
is that spring, summer or winter
They're always changing moods and colors
But how many hearts in the wild
have dreamed of adventure
By letting the years slip by without wondering
At the bend in the river,
will he be at the bend in the river
Braving the waves,
this sea traveller
On his boat
and still I believe
I still hope
that this stranger will come
At the bend of the river
for me
just for me
While joking, the wind is blowing
torrents of laughter cascading down the drain
The drums, night and day, resound with love
But the one I'd like to choose
to build the future
Will it come from the land or the blue seas?
At the bend in the river,
at the bend in the river
I'm waiting, I hope.
than at the bend in the river
He'll be there.
seafaring
Just for me
in a dream of light
At the bend in the river,
at the bend in the river
Should I extinguish my flame
in a quiet riverbed
By marrying Kocoum
to stop dreaming about that man?
I would so like to escape, traveler,
on the river of your heart
