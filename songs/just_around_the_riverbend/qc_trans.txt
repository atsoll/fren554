The river takes a thousand and one faces
Along the waters and its shores
Its waves redraw it at any moment.
But people can't live like this
Like the waters of a torrent
Living safely, how boring!
Beyond the river
I suck beyond the river.
I feel the call
Beyond the river
Mystery Flow
In the song of the wind
The appeal is
The call is ringing in me.
Beyond the river!
Inside me,
that flows through me...
Deep inside of me is a bubbling envy
To look further into my destiny.
Can I ignore the drumbeat of my people?
Knowing that Great Warrior
will build a home for me
To share a life that will never go!
Beyond the river!
Beyond the river!
I see far away
Beyond the river
All my destiny
Beyond the seas
What am I going to do?
Why on earth are my dreams going to...
Beyond the river!
Beyond the river!
Do I want to finally live
My whole life with this man?
Shall I marry Kokum?
Is my dream gone?
Where's a tomorrow for the two of us?
Beyond the river...
