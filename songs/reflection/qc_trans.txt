Look at me
I'll have such a hard time forming the image
of an ideal woman
Being a wife,
it would be quite normal, though.
I'd like so much
To be able to live according to what my heart tells me
Without breaking my parents'.
Who's the one I see?
Who is following me step by step?
Why does my reflection betray who I am?
In my soul and conscience
I'll forget.
etiquette
Will my reflection one day say
the whole truth?
Will my reflection one day say
my whole truth?
