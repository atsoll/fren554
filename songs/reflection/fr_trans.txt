No, never ever
I won't be made for marriage.
Nor a very wise girl
I know that. I know that.
This life is not for me
I understood
That if I want to remain what I am
My parents will be bruised
What is this mirage?
This faceless image
Why, mirror, do you think without seeing me
I search in my memory
Who I am
To know more about it
Lost in these reflections
Where my soul goes astray
In my mirror of illusions
What girl I'm going to see
